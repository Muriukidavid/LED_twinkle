Module "Bits1"     (component BitsIO_LDD)
   - Bits1_Init -This method initializes the associated peripheral(s) and the component internal variables. The method is 
                called automatically as a part of the application initialization code.
   - Bits1_GetVal -Returns the value of the Input/Output component. If the direction is [input] then reads the input value of 
                the pins and returns it. If the direction is [output] then returns the last written value (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations).
   - Bits1_PutVal -Specified value is passed to the Input/Output component. If the direction is [input] saves the value to a 
                memory or a register, this value will be written to the pins after switching to the output mode - using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)] (see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output] it writes the value to 
                the pins. (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Bits1_GetBit -Returns the value of the specified bit/pin of the Input/Output component. If the direction is [input] then 
                it reads the input value of the pin and returns it. If the direction is [output] then it returns the last 
                written value (see <Safe mode> property for limitations).
   - Bits1_PutBit -Specified value is passed to the specified bit/pin of the Input/Output component. If the direction is 
                [input] it saves the value to a memory or register, this value will be written to the pin after switching to 
                the output mode - using [SetDir(TRUE)] (see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output] 
                it writes the value to the pin. (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Bits1_SetBit -Sets (to one) the specified bit of the Input/Output component. It is the same as [PutBit(Bit, TRUE)]. 
                (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Bits1_ClrBit -Clears (sets to zero) the specified bit of the Input/Output component. It is the same as [PutBit(Bit, FALSE)
                ]. (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Bits1_NegBit -Negates (inverts) the specified bit of the Input/Output component. It is the same as [PutBit(Bit,!GetBit(Bit)
                )]. (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).

Module "WAIT1"     (component Wait)
   - WAIT1_Wait10Cycles -Wait for 10 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_Wait100Cycles -Wait for 100 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_WaitCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (16bit data type).
   - WAIT1_WaitLongCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (32bit data type).
   - WAIT1_Waitms -Wait for a specified time in milliseconds.
   - WAIT1_Waitus -Wait for a specified time in microseconds.
   - WAIT1_Waitns -Wait for a specified time in nano seconds.
   - WAIT1_WaitOSms -If an RTOS is enabled, this routine will use a non-blocking wait method. Otherwise it will do a 
                busy/blocking wait.

Module "SysTick"   (component Init_SysTick_VAR0)
   - SysTick_Init -This method initializes registers of the SysTick module according to the Peripheral Initialization settings. 
                Call this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; 
                see "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "TI1"       (component TimerInt_LDD)
   - TI1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.
   - TI1_Enable -Enables the component - it starts the signal generation. Events may be generated (see SetEventMask).
   - TI1_Disable -Disables the component - it stops signal generation and events calling.

Module "TU1"       (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - TU1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.
   - TU1_Enable -Enables the component - it starts the signal generation. Events may be generated (see SetEventMask). The 
                method is not available if the counter can't be disabled/enabled by HW.
   - TU1_Disable -Disables the component - it stops signal generation and events calling. The method is not available if the 
                counter can't be disabled/enabled by HW.

Module "Cpu"       (component MKL05Z32LC4)
